# Efficient Routing Techniques for Traffic Control 🚦🛣️

A smart traffic management system that implements efficient routing algorithms to optimize vehicle flow and reduce congestion in urban areas. The project simulates traffic conditions and evaluates pathfinding techniques for better decision-making in real-time scenarios.

## 🧾 Overview

- Simulates traffic networks and intersections  
- Implements pathfinding algorithms for efficient route selection  
- Evaluates performance metrics such as travel time and congestion levels  
- Aimed at improving urban traffic flow using data and logic-based models

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `networkx` – graph-based road network modeling  
  - `matplotlib` – visualizing routes and traffic  
  - `numpy` – data handling and computations  
  - `tkinter` or similar (if UI simulation used)  
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook / Python script

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic graph-based traffic network simulation  
- Shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s, A*)  
- Congestion-aware route selection  
- Visualization of routes and traffic flows  
- Customizable road networks and traffic parameters
